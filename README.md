# Kendall Frost Marsh Deployment and Analysis


Sean Perry and Wesley Wu from the Engineers for Exploration Lab at UCSD deployed an AudioMoth and HydroMoth at the Kendall Frost Marsh on 3/8/2025 to 4/5/2025 to gather San Diego bird recordings. 
We processed the recordings through BirdNET, a widely used pre-trained machine learning model for bird species detection and identification, and verified some of the detected species and wav files.
With BirdNET's results acting as the baseline for comparison, we plan to train models specifically with a dataset of San Diego bird vocalizations to improve detection accuracy and work with experts to help us verify and label our findings.
